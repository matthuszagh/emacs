\section{Ivy/Swiper to Helm}\label{sec:ivyswiper-helm}

Consider changing ivy and swiper to Helm. Helm is a larger project and may therefore be better
maintained with more features. The downside to this might be slower autocompletion times in which
case it may not be worth changing. If you do make the change, make sure to adjust
\lstinline{custom-set-faces} for Helm instead of ivy.


\section{Powerline Custom Mode-Line Configuration for Specific Modes}
\label{sec:powerl-cust-mode}

I'm experiencing an issue with powerline. I'd like to be able to display 2 different mode lines
depending on whether I'm in pdf-view-mode or not. When displaying a PDF I'd like to display the
current page and the total number of pages instead of the current row/column position of the
cursor. In all other modes I'd like to display the row/column position of the cursor. The issue
seems to be that powerline does not allow setting different configurations for different major
modes. For instance, if I set a hook for pdf-view-mode, it will then stay in force for other
buffers. I'm not eager to go back to the default mode line because it doesn't show the file size and
doesn't look as good as the powerline mode line. It's probably a good idea to verify with the
powerline developers that different modes are not possible. Another possible solution might be
spaceline. Or, maybe I can get the buffer size in the default mode line display (look at powerline
function).
